#+TITLE: roambatch.el

Batch insert multiple org-roam nodes at once using Helm multi-selection. Instead of inserting one org-roam node link at a time, it lets you mark multiple nodes and insert them all together. Each link is inserted on its own line.

** Installation

*** Requirements

- Emacs 27.1 or later
- [org-roam 2.0+][https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam]
- [Helm 3.0+][https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm]

*** Manual Installation

Clone or download this repository and add to your =load-path=:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/roambatch")
(require 'roambatch)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n b") 'roambatch)
#+end_src

*** Using straight.el

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package roambatch
  :straight (:host github :repo "yourusername/roambatch")
  :bind ("C-c n b" . roambatch)
  :after (org-roam helm))
#+end_src

*** Using package.el (After MELPA submission)
The package can be installed via MELPA. The package name is roambatch.

#+begin_src elisp
M-x package-install RET roambatch
#+end_src

** Configuration

To change the keybinding, add to your config:

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'roambatch)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n b") 'roambatch)
#+end_src


*** With Evil Mode

#+begin_src elisp
;; Normal mode binding
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "gnb") 'roambatch)

;; Evil ex-command
(with-eval-after-load 'evil
  (evil-ex-define-cmd "nib" 'roambatch))
#+end_src

Then use:
- =gnb= in normal mode
- =:nib= in command mode

*** Disable j/k Navigation

If you prefer to use arrow keys instead of =j=/=k= for navigation, or want to disable custom navigation entirely, you can customize the keybindings in the package. Check the source code for modification points.

** Features

- =Batch selection=: Mark multiple org-roam nodes with =M-SPC=
- =Dynamic search=: Type to filter nodes while you're searching
- =Navigation=: Use ,/. to navigate results 
- =Flexible marking=: Mark/unmark nodes, or mark all visible at once
- =Clean formatting=: Each inserted link appears on its own line

** Usage

1. Call =M-x roambatch= or keybinding 
2. Type to search for org-roam nodes
3. Press =M-SPC= to mark nodes you want to insert
4. Press =RET= to insert all marked nodes
5. Each link appears on a new line in your buffer

**# Default bindings in Helm Buffer

| Key         | Action                          |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| =M-SPC=     | Mark/unmark current node        |
| =,=         | Navigate down to next result    |
| =.=         | Navigate up to previous result  |
| =C-;=       | Mark all visible nodes          |
| =/=         | Search (type to filter)         |
| =RET=       | Insert all marked nodes         |
| =C-g=       | Cancel                          |


** Troubleshooting

*** "org-roam is not available" error

Ensure you have installed and loaded org-roam:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-roam
  :ensure t
  :init
  (setq org-roam-v2-ack t)
  :config
  (org-roam-setup))
#+end_src

*** "helm is not available" error

Ensure Helm is installed:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package helm
  :ensure t
  :config
  (helm-mode 1))
#+end_src
